# Car Price Analysis & Power BI Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes car price trends using **Python** and visualizes key insights through an interactive **Power BI dashboard**. The dataset includes variables such as **year, mileage, transmission type, fuel type, number of doors, and previous owners**, which influence car pricing.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scipy)** for data analysis and statistical testing
- **Power BI** for interactive dashboard creation
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** for advanced calculations
- **GitHub** for project versioning and documentation

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Car Depreciation**: Older cars tend to have significantly lower prices.
- **Transmission Type**: Automatic cars are more expensive than manual and semi-automatic ones.
- **Fuel Type Impact**: Electric and hybrid cars show significantly different price ranges.
- **Mileage Effect**: Cars with lower mileage generally have higher prices.
- **Number of Owners**: The number of previous owners does not significantly impact price.
- **Number of Doors**: Car prices do not vary significantly based on door count.

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard Features
The interactive dashboard includes:
- **Filters**: Year, Transmission, Fuel Type, Mileage, and Number of Owners
- **Visuals**:
  - Line chart showing price trends over the years
  - Scatter plot analyzing price vs. mileage
  - Boxplots comparing transmission and fuel type pricing
  - Heatmap for correlation insights
